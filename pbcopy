They way we think about career level is that we can't help people learn how to design, code, or product manage: what we can do is help people learn about the challenges faced by low income folks. We rely on our fellows to already have all of the skills needed, without substantial outside mentoring and help, to launch a new venture in their field: be it UI/UX, software engineering etc.
