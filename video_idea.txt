video:
start button, end button for each camera
start button starts video, returns streaming url
url is passed to ffmpeg, which opens up file: stairway.mp4
once that is returned to front end we use js to open up sinatra stream to stairway.mp4


close stream: on navigate away, we stop the stream with JS calling sinatra to call arlo.

possibly use this instead? https://github.com/chpmrc/foscam_streamer
foscams streamer edit: take in rtsp stream and port as command line, and stream to port.

flow: 
  click start stream to arlo -> get stream url 
  pass to foscamstreamer and pass port to front end. pid = Process.spawn("ls -arlo")
  save foscam_stream pid in redis and use to kill later on.
  js opens port or proxies through sinatra and plays video
  button click to end stream -> ends js stream and sends message to stop stream at arlo


use https://github.com/phoboslab/jsmpeg to play video
