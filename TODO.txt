organizations:
by default, no user has an organization.

data-organization=false

Users can add an organization on their registration page.

You type into an autocomplete field and select. If organization is not found, then you are given the option to add a new one with an image.

Data Structure:
key: organization:#{ name } => organization
key: image:#{organization} => image url
set: slack_members:#{organization} => slack_ids

in the feed, we add organization to worker

with each new worker, we check to see if the organization is on the page, and if yes, we append slack_id to a data-members array and update lastseen.

if no, we query for organization image and display organization.
