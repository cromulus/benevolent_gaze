models:
  worker
    name
    slackid
    slack name
    image
    list of orgs
    has many organizations

  devices
    device name
    -> worker

  organizations
    name
    image
    has many workers

organizations:
  by default, no user has an organization.
  - data-organization=false

  Users can add an organization on their registration page.

  You type into an autocomplete field and select. If organization is not found, then you are given the option to add a new one with an image.

  Data Structure:
    key: organization:#{ name } => organization
    key: image:#{organization} => image url
    set: slack_members:#{organization} => slack_ids

  in the feed, we add organization to worker

  with each new worker, we check to see if the organization is on the page, and if yes, we append slack_id to a data-members array and update lastseen.

  if no, we query for organization image and display organization.
